# examples
Examples of Spring Boot applications hosting some kind of service:

 * gRPC 
 * REST

or both. There is also examples of application without test artifacts, as examples of what a deployed application will actually see.

Please note:

 * The examples have unit tests which try out various configuration settings
 * For local development, a shortened 'classic' one-line is the default
 * To examine log statements in more details use `CompositeConsoleOutputControl.useHumanReadableJsonEncoder()` for JSON output
